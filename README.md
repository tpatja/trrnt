# trrnt

A library implementing the BitTorrent protocol in Clojure inspired by [Tulva](https://github.com/jtakkala/tulva). A pet project for learning Clojure. May grow into an actually working BitTorrent client one day.

TODO:
* ~~bencode decode & encode~~
* ~~TCP tracker support~~
* ~~UDP tracker support~~
* peer-wire-protocol
* DHT (Kademlia) support
